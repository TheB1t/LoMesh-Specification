1.  Introduction

   LoMesh is a stateless, minimalistic mesh transport protocol designed for
   decentralized, resource-constrained, and heterogeneous environments.
   It enables autonomous nodes to establish logical communication channels
   (Chains) across arbitrary physical networks, without relying on global
   addressing, centralized routing, or persistent network-wide state.

   LoMesh separates physical connectivity (Pipes) from logical connections
   (Chains) through strictly local, hop-by-hop commutation. Each node forwards
   data based solely on local mapping tables, with no requirement for global
   knowledge or topological awareness. The protocol is agnostic to physical
   media and can be implemented over any bidirectional byte stream, including
   serial links, wireless radios, and virtual tunnels.

   Discovery and session establishment in LoMesh are achieved via a broadcast-
   based request (REQ) mechanism and a unicast acknowledgment (ACK) path,
   forming the foundation of logical channel (Chain) setup. Data transmission
   follows the established Chain using only locally meaningful connection
   identifiers (CID) and physical pipe identifiers (PipeID).

   LoMesh is suitable for autonomous peer-to-peer networks, intermittently
   connected systems, or mesh overlays where minimalism, resilience, and
   independence from legacy infrastructure are required. All forwarding and
   state logic is strictly local; the protocol deliberately omits advanced
   features such as global routing, discovery floods, or network-layer
   addressing. Security, reliability, and higher-layer features are
   intentionally left out of scope for the core specification and may be
   layered above as needed.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document with specific meaning:

   - **Node**: An autonomous device implementing the LoMesh protocol.

   - **Pipe**: A bidirectional physical or logical communication channel
     between two directly connected Nodes. The nature of a Pipe (wired, wireless,
     virtual) is abstracted from the protocol logic.

   - **PipeID**: A locally unique identifier assigned by a Node to each of its
     available Pipes. PipeID is not globally unique or externally visible.

   - **PhysicalNodeID**: An identifier for a Node within the local context of a
     Pipe or physical link. It may be derived from hardware, configuration, or
     protocol negotiation, and has scope limited to the local Pipe.

   - **LogicalNodeID**: An abstract identifier for a Node, used only during
     session establishment (REQ/ACK). LogicalNodeID may be ephemeral or
     persistent, but is not used in data forwarding.

   - **CID (Connection Identifier)**: A Node-local identifier for an active
     logical channel (Chain) established between two endpoints. CIDs are
     unique only within the context of a Node and the lifetime of the Chain.

   - **Chain**: A logical end-to-end communication session established between
     two Nodes, traversing one or more Pipes via intermediate Nodes. Chains
     are realized as a sequence of hop-local CID mappings.

   - **Commutation Table**: A Node-local table mapping incoming data flows
     (identified by CID and PipeID) to outgoing flows (mapped to a possibly
     different CID and PipeID). The Commutation Table enables hop-by-hop
     forwarding without global path knowledge.

   - **Endpoint Table**: A Node-local structure mapping remote Node
     identifiers (LogicalNodeID or PhysicalNodeID) to ingress/egress pairs
     (CID, PipeID), allowing a Node to associate external connections with
     local state.

   - **REQ (Request)**: A broadcast session initiation message sent by a Node
     to discover and establish a logical Chain toward a target LogicalNodeID.
     The REQ accumulates a reverse path as it propagates.

   - **ACK (Acknowledgment)**: A unicast message sent by the target Node in
     response to a REQ, traversing the accumulated reverse path to confirm
     and establish the Chain. The ACK enables Nodes along the path to allocate
     local CIDs and build Commutation Table entries.

   - **Suppression Table**: A temporary cache for deduplication of REQ messages
     and suppression of redundant broadcasts during session establishment.

   - **Session**: The period between successful establishment of a Chain and
     its explicit teardown, during which data can be exchanged via the
     corresponding CIDs.

   All identifiers are opaque and implementation-defined in length, format,
   and encoding, except where scope or uniqueness is specified in this document.

3.  Architecture Overview

   LoMesh enables autonomous Nodes to form a mesh network over arbitrary
   physical or virtual media. The protocol architecture is designed around
   strict separation of physical connectivity (Pipes) and logical sessions
   (Chains), with all forwarding and control logic realized as hop-local state
   machines. There is no concept of global addressing, global routing tables,
   or persistent network topology knowledge.

   Each Node maintains a set of Pipes, each identified by a local PipeID.
   Pipes may correspond to point-to-point links, broadcast-capable media,
   or virtual transports, but are always managed as local resources.

   Logical communication between Nodes is established through Chains. A
   Chain is a session built incrementally by propagating a REQ (Request)
   message toward a target LogicalNodeID. The REQ accumulates the necessary
   information for constructing the reverse path (e.g., ingress PipeIDs)
   as it traverses the mesh. Upon reaching the destination, an ACK
   (Acknowledgment) message is returned along the recorded path; each Node
   allocates Node-local CIDs and builds the necessary Commutation Table
   entries as the ACK traverses the path.

   All data transfer in LoMesh occurs along established Chains, with each
   hop translating local CIDs and PipeIDs per the Node's Commutation Table.
   The protocol is fundamentally hop-by-hop: Nodes forward data based only
   on local information, with no awareness or persistence of the global
   network structure.

   LoMesh is intentionally minimal: it provides no global discovery, no
   address advertisement, no network-layer routing, and no built-in
   encryption or authentication. Higher-layer features, such as directory
   services, security, and reliability, are intended to be layered above
   the core protocol.

   The protocol supports both unidirectional and bidirectional Chains,
   as explicitly requested during session establishment. The absence of
   global state ensures robustness in dynamic, partitioned, or ephemeral
   network environments, making LoMesh well suited for IoT, ad-hoc,
   and autonomous mesh deployments.

4.  Node and Channel Model

   Each LoMesh Node is an independent agent responsible for managing local
   Pipes, session establishment, forwarding, and state. The protocol requires
   no fixed roles, centralized elements, or global configuration; all Nodes
   are equivalent from a protocol perspective.

   **Pipes:**  
   - A Pipe is a bidirectional communication channel, uniquely identified
     by a PipeID within the Node.
   - Pipes may be hardware interfaces (e.g., UART, SPI, CAN, RF, etc.),
     logical transports (e.g., virtual TUN/TAP), or layered atop any medium
     capable of transporting bytes bidirectionally.
   - A Node may have any number of Pipes, each independently managed.

   **Chains:**  
   - A Chain is a logical session constructed between two Nodes, possibly
     traversing multiple intermediate Nodes and Pipes.
   - Each Chain is realized as a sequence of hop-local mappings: at each Node,
     a pair (or pair-set, for bidirectional Chains) of locally-allocated CIDs
     corresponds to the ingress and egress Pipes for that session.

   **Commutation Table:**  
   - Each Node maintains a Commutation Table mapping inbound data flows
     (identified by [PipeID, CID]) to outbound flows ([PipeID, CID]).
   - The mapping is strictly local: CIDs are unique only within the Node,
     and the association is valid only for the lifetime of the Chain.
   - Bidirectional Chains are represented as two coordinated, but logically
     independent, entries (one per direction).

   **Endpoint Table:**  
   - Each endpoint Node (originator and target of the Chain) maintains an
     Endpoint Table mapping the session with a remote Node to the associated
     local PipeID and CIDs for ingress and egress.
   - This allows applications or higher layers to interface with the
     protocol via stable handles for each active session.

   **Session Lifecycle:**  
   - Chains are established through the REQ/ACK handshake (see Section 6).
   - Data is forwarded hop-by-hop, using only local mappings.
   - Sessions are torn down explicitly by teardown messages propagated along
     the established Chain, or implicitly via local resource management.

   **Node Autonomy:**  
   - Each Node is free to accept or reject REQ, to limit session counts,
     to arbitrate Pipe access, or to implement local policy. The protocol
     requires no consensus or synchronization beyond what is needed for
     per-hop state coordination.

   The Node and Channel Model in LoMesh is deliberately minimal, ensuring
   protocol resilience, ease of implementation, and applicability to
   constrained and heterogeneous environments.

5.  Addressing and Identifiers

   LoMesh employs strictly local, implementation-defined identifiers to
   distinguish resources and establish session state. The protocol
   separates identifiers by scope and function:

   **PhysicalNodeID:**  
   - Represents the physical or hardware identity of a Node as perceived
     on a given Pipe.  
   - Typically derived from device serial number, hardware MAC, or unique
     configuration.  
   - Its scope is limited to the local Pipe context and serves to uniquely
     distinguish endpoints at the physical layer.
   - Used during Pipe initialization, low-level diagnostics, or for
     access control, but never in logical forwarding or session discovery.

   **PipeID:**  
   - A Node-local identifier for each active Pipe.
   - There is a bijective mapping between PipeID and PhysicalNodeID for all
     directly connected neighbors: each PipeID corresponds to one PhysicalNodeID,
     and vice versa, within the Node.
   - PipeID is used in Commutation and Endpoint Tables to direct traffic
     and manage session paths; it is not exposed beyond the local Node.

   **LogicalNodeID:**  
   - An abstract identifier used solely during session setup (REQ/ACK) to
     target, discover, or advertise a Node for logical connections.
   - May be ephemeral (session-specific) or persistent (configured), but is
     not required to be globally unique.
   - After session establishment, LogicalNodeID does not appear in forwarded
     packets.

   **CID (Connection Identifier):**  
   - A Node-local identifier for each logical flow (Chain) segment.
   - Assigned independently by each Node as part of the REQ/ACK handshake.
   - CIDs are valid only for the lifetime of the session and only within
     the Node's context.
   - Used to index Commutation Table and label data packets locally.

   **Summary Table:**

   | Identifier      | Scope       | Lifetime     | Purpose                 |
   |-----------------|------------ |------------- |-------------------------|
   | PhysicalNodeID  | Pipe-local  | Hardware     | Pipe association, diag  |
   | PipeID          | Node-local  | Node session | Data path selection     |
   | LogicalNodeID   | Session     | REQ/ACK      | Discovery/targeting     |
   | CID             | Node-local  | Session      | Data commutation        |

   All identifiers are opaque; their format and length are implementation-
   defined except where required by scope. No identifier is assumed globally
   unique across the mesh. LoMesh does not define, require, or propagate
   any form of network-wide addressing.

   The strong separation of physical, logical, and session identifiers
   ensures LoMesh can function atop heterogeneous hardware, supports
   robust privacy properties, and avoids global state complexity.

6.  Session Establishment (REQ/ACK)

   LoMesh establishes logical channels (Chains) between Nodes via a strictly
   two-phase handshake: a broadcast Request (REQ) and a unicast Acknowledgment
   (ACK). This mechanism enables decentralized discovery, explicit path setup,
   and per-hop resource allocation, all without global routing or address
   resolution.

   **Phase 1: REQ Propagation**
   - A Node wishing to establish a Chain initiates a REQ message containing:
       • The initiator's LogicalNodeID (ephemeral or persistent, as configured)
       • The target LogicalNodeID
       • A ChainType flag (e.g., bidirectional, unidirectional)
       • An empty reverse path trace (a stack of ingress PipeIDs)
   - The REQ is broadcast over all or selected Pipes. Each receiving Node:
       • Checks for duplicate REQ using its Suppression Table (drops repeats)
       • Appends the incoming PipeID to the reverse path trace
       • Forwards the REQ further (broadcast or constrained flooding), subject
         to scope/policy/TTL constraints
   - The REQ accumulates a strictly ordered path back to the initiator, built
     solely from the sequence of traversed PipeIDs.

   **Phase 2: ACK Return Path**
   - Upon receiving a REQ matching its own LogicalNodeID, the target Node:
       • Allocates one or two local CIDs (per direction requested)
       • Creates a corresponding Endpoint Table entry
       • Prepares an ACK message containing the assigned local CIDs and
         the recorded reverse path trace
   - The ACK is returned as a unicast, retracing the path in reverse order.
     At each hop, the Node:
       • Allocates its own local CID(s) for the session direction(s)
       • Updates the ACK, replacing prior CIDs with its own
       • Inserts commutation entries in its Commutation Table:
           { inCID, inPipe } → { outCID, outPipe }
         for each direction as required by ChainType
   - The initiator, upon receiving the ACK, finalizes its Endpoint Table and
     considers the Chain established.

   **Properties:**
   - Each hop's CID assignments are strictly local and do not leak upstream
     or downstream.
   - The reverse path trace is never stored beyond session setup; after ACK
     completes, all routing is via commutation tables.
   - Flooding of REQ is contained by Suppression Table, TTL, or policy.
   - There is no broadcast at the data transmission phase; all forwarding is
     unicast and table-driven.
   - Session teardown is performed by propagating a teardown message along
     the established Chain, removing the corresponding CIDs and table entries
     at each hop.

   This handshake enables deterministic, directionally-explicit channel
   setup, and forms the basis for all higher-layer interactions in LoMesh.

7.  Data Forwarding and Flow

   Once a Chain is established via the REQ/ACK handshake, data transmission
   proceeds in a strictly hop-by-hop manner. Each packet is forwarded
   according to the Node's Commutation Table, which maps incoming
   (PipeID, CID) pairs to outgoing (PipeID, CID) pairs for each active session.

   **Data Packet Handling:**
   - A data packet received on a given Pipe, carrying a locally valid CID,
     is looked up in the Commutation Table.
   - If a matching entry exists:
       • The Node rewrites the packet's CID as specified by the mapping.
       • The packet is transmitted out the corresponding Pipe.
   - If no matching entry is found, the packet is dropped silently or, at
     the implementer's option, may trigger an error response.

   **CID Translation:**
   - CIDs are strictly local to each Node; translation occurs at every hop.
   - The data plane does not preserve or propagate source, destination,
     or global identifiers—only local CIDs and PipeIDs.
   - This design inherently limits information leakage and network-wide
     traceability.

   **Bidirectional and Unidirectional Flow:**
   - For bidirectional Chains, two independent Commutation Table entries are
     installed per direction, allowing independent translation of CIDs for
     each data path.
   - Unidirectional Chains require only a single entry, with data flow in
     the established direction.

   **Session Integrity:**
   - Data forwarding is stateless with respect to network topology or
     path. All logic is embodied in the current Commutation Table entries.
   - Chain liveness and error detection are out of scope for the core
     protocol but may be layered above (e.g., via keepalives, timeouts).

   **Teardown:**
   - Session teardown is initiated by either endpoint, propagating a
     teardown message along the established Chain. Each Node, upon
     receiving such a message, removes the associated entries from its
     Commutation and Endpoint Tables.

   **Summary:**
   - Data forwarding in LoMesh is hop-local, table-driven, and blind to
     global network state.
   - There is no global addressing, routing, or packet traceability.
   - The system is robust to topology changes, partitioning, and resource
     constraints, as forwarding always depends only on the current Node's
     local state.

   This model enables deterministic, scalable mesh forwarding with minimal
   per-node resource and protocol complexity.

8.  Commutation Table Logic

   The Commutation Table is the core structure enabling hop-by-hop
   forwarding in LoMesh. It maintains strictly local state, mapping each
   active session’s incoming flow (identified by PipeID and CID) to an
   outgoing flow (PipeID and CID) as determined during session establishment.

   **Table Structure:**
   - Each entry is uniquely indexed by an (IngressPipeID, IngressCID) tuple.
   - Each entry specifies (EgressPipeID, EgressCID) for forwarding.
   - For bidirectional Chains, separate entries are installed for each
     direction, ensuring strict logical independence.

   **Entry Lifecycle:**
   - On session establishment (via ACK traversal), the Node allocates new
     local CIDs and installs corresponding commutation entries.
   - Each entry is valid only for the lifetime of its Chain segment; upon
     session teardown or resource reclaim, entries are removed.

   **Operation:**
   - Upon receiving a data packet:
       • The Node looks up the packet’s (PipeID, CID) in the table.
       • If a match is found, the packet’s CID is rewritten as EgressCID and
         forwarded through EgressPipeID.
       • If no match is found, the packet is discarded or a local error may
         be signaled.
   - The table may be implemented as a hash, array, or other efficient
     structure, depending on Node constraints and expected session counts.

   **Bidirectionality and Asymmetry:**
   - The protocol permits asymmetric Chains; the forward and reverse paths
     may be established over different routes, PipeIDs, or even have
     differing lifetimes.

   **No Global State:**
   - The Commutation Table is strictly local; it does not contain or infer
     any information about the overall network topology, global paths,
     or remote Node state.

   **Resource Management:**
   - The number of concurrent sessions (Chains) and Commutation Table size
     are limited only by local Node policy and resource availability.
   - Nodes MAY evict or refuse new sessions if limits are reached; such
     events are handled locally and need not be signaled to the network.

   **Security Note:**
   - All state is hop-local and ephemeral. No identifier or mapping persists
     beyond session teardown, ensuring that stale routes or identifiers do
     not leak or accumulate.

   The Commutation Table embodies the LoMesh design philosophy: forwarding
   and state are always local, minimal, and deterministic, regardless of
   mesh scale or dynamism.

9.  Physical Channel Arbitration (Optional)

   In deployments where Pipes correspond to shared or contention-based physical
   media (e.g., wireless links, bus architectures), LoMesh supports an optional
   arbitration mechanism to coordinate access and prevent collisions between
   competing Nodes or protocol implementations.

   **Applicability:**
   - Arbitration is REQUIRED only for shared media where simultaneous transmissions
     may interfere or collide.
   - For point-to-point or inherently collision-free channels (e.g., direct serial
     links, dedicated virtual tunnels), arbitration MAY be omitted if no conflict
     can arise.

   **Arbitration Model:**
   - Arbitration is performed at the Pipe level, prior to transmission of LoMesh
     protocol messages or data.
   - A basic finite-state-machine (FSM) is used to coordinate access:
       • Nodes signal intent to transmit using a SYNC message or equivalent.
       • The channel is held during transmission (BEGIN), released upon completion
         (END).
       • If multiple Nodes contend for access, a backoff or randomized delay MAY
         be employed to avoid repeated collisions.
   - The specific signaling, timing, and contention resolution algorithms are
     implementation-defined but MUST be interoperable across compliant LoMesh
     Nodes sharing the same medium.

   **Arbitration State Transitions:**
   - FREE: Channel is idle; any Node may initiate SYNC.
   - CONTENDING: Multiple Nodes request access; contention resolution occurs.
   - MASTER: Node holds channel and may transmit (BEGIN ... END).
   - BACKOFF: Node defers after unsuccessful contention, reattempts after delay.

   **Interoperability:**
   - All LoMesh implementations operating on a shared medium MUST implement the
     same arbitration protocol if collisions are possible.
   - The arbitration mechanism is logically independent of LoMesh session and
     forwarding logic; it precedes protocol-level actions and does not alter
     the structure of Chains or data packets.

   **Omission:**
   - In deployments with dedicated, collision-free Pipes, arbitration logic
     MAY be omitted entirely, and Nodes may transmit freely.

   Physical Channel Arbitration ensures LoMesh can operate robustly and fairly
   across a wide range of physical media, including environments with high node
   density or heterogeneous device capabilities.

10.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   The core LoMesh protocol is deliberately minimal and does not provide
   built-in mechanisms for authentication, encryption, integrity verification,
   or trust management. All protocol messages, including REQ, ACK, and data
   packets, are forwarded in cleartext, and no security assumptions are made
   about network participants or physical media.

   **Security Properties:**
   - **Locality of State:** CIDs, PipeIDs, and all routing state are strictly
     Node-local, reducing the attack surface for global state poisoning,
     replay, or remote injection.
   - **No Global Addressing:** The absence of network-wide identifiers, address
     advertisement, or route discovery precludes many traditional network-layer
     attacks (e.g., ARP spoofing, route poisoning, network scanning).
   - **Suppression Table for Flood Control:** The deduplication of REQ messages
     via Suppression Table mitigates basic broadcast amplification or flooding
     attacks during session setup.

   **Residual Risks:**
   - **Eavesdropping:** All traffic is unencrypted and may be captured by
     adversaries with access to the physical medium.
   - **MITM/Impersonation:** Protocol does not authenticate Nodes or session
     establishment, allowing malicious relays or MITM on open channels.
   - **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker may attempt to exhaust session state,
     Commutation Table entries, or Suppression Table space by generating
     excessive REQ or data flows.
   - **Traffic Analysis/Tracking:** Repeated use of static LogicalNodeIDs or
     observable patterns in Pipe usage may enable basic tracking or correlation.

   **Recommended Mitigations (Out-of-Scope):**
   - Implementations and deployments MAY layer cryptographic security above
     LoMesh (e.g., end-to-end encryption, HMAC, mutual authentication).
   - Ephemeral or randomized LogicalNodeIDs SHOULD be preferred for privacy.
   - Per-Node rate limiting, resource allocation, and session quotas SHOULD
     be applied to resist abuse.
   - Sensitive applications SHOULD avoid exposing static Node IDs or cleartext
     traffic over insecure media.

   **Privacy:**
   - The protocol's design favors privacy by default: minimal metadata,
     absence of global addressing, and hop-local state all reduce information
     leakage.
   - However, ultimate privacy depends on physical medium, upper-layer protocols,
     and operational discipline.

   Security and privacy are expected to be addressed by dedicated profiles,
   extensions, or application-layer protocols layered atop LoMesh.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

   No protocol numbers, message types, codepoints, or registries are defined
   or requested by this specification. All identifiers and message formats
   are implementation-defined and scoped locally to each Node or session.

   Any future LoMesh extensions or protocol variants that require standardized
   numbers, registries, or code assignments MUST define corresponding IANA
   considerations in their respective specifications.

Appendix A.  LoMesh Design Principles

   The following principles underpin the LoMesh protocol design:

     - Statelessness: No Node maintains global topology, routing, or neighbor
       state. All forwarding and session logic is strictly local.

     - Locality: All identifiers, session state, and forwarding decisions are
       Node-local and do not propagate beyond the immediate context.

     - Minimalism: Protocol core is intentionally limited to essential
       mechanisms—no address advertisement, route distribution, or global
       metadata is included.

     - Hardware Agnosticism: LoMesh is independent of physical and link-layer
       technologies, and is defined only in terms of bidirectional byte
       streams (Pipes).

     - Determinism: Behavior of Nodes and session state transitions is fully
       determined by the protocol and local state, enabling reproducible and
       testable implementations.

     - Extensibility: All advanced features (reliability, encryption,
       authentication, capability-based relay, etc.) are intended to be
       layered above the core protocol or implemented via deployment-specific
       profiles.

     - Privacy-by-Design: Absence of global addresses, route discovery, and
       persistent identifiers limits information leakage and tracking.

     - Robustness: LoMesh is inherently resilient to dynamic topologies,
       partial failures, and heterogeneous deployment, as no state is global
       or irreplaceable.

   These principles are not normative but inform the protocol’s design,
   rationale, and future extensions.

Appendix B.  Node Capabilities Advertising and Selection (Informative)

   LoMesh enables, but does not require, the optional advertisement and
   selection of Node capabilities. Capabilities are Node-local attributes
   describing hardware, resource, or policy characteristics that may be
   relevant for session setup, peer selection, or relay optimization in
   heterogeneous mesh deployments.

   **Definition of Capabilities:**
   - A capability is any self-declared property of a Node or Pipe, such as:
       • Available bandwidth, link quality, or latency class
       • Power source (battery, mains, energy harvesting, etc.)
       • Willingness to serve as a relay, backbone, or directory node
       • Session quotas or admission policies
       • Supported protocol extensions or physical media
   - Capabilities are implementation-defined and not standardized by the
     LoMesh core specification.

   **Mechanisms for Advertisement:**
   - Capability information MAY be exchanged during Pipe initialization,
     via management frames, or in application-layer signaling.
   - Mesh-wide or network-broadcast advertisement is NOT RECOMMENDED due to
     flooding and privacy risks.
   - Instead, capabilities SHOULD be shared with directly connected peers
     or designated directory/relay Nodes.
   - The format, encoding, and semantics of capabilities are out-of-scope
     for this specification and are to be defined in deployment profiles or
     higher-layer protocols.

   **Usage in Session Setup:**
   - Initiators MAY use known or observed capabilities to influence peer
     selection, relay choice, or path construction during session establishment
     (REQ/ACK).
   - Directory or relay Nodes MAY aggregate, cache, or provide capability
     lookup services, subject to local policy.

   **Security and Privacy Considerations:**
   - Nodes SHOULD avoid advertising sensitive or fingerprintable information
     unless required for interoperability.
   - Capability exchange SHOULD be subject to local access policy and MAY
     be obfuscated, randomized, or limited to trusted counterparts.
   - No authentication, verification, or attestation mechanism for capabilities
     is defined in LoMesh core; deployments requiring integrity MUST provide
     their own means.

   **Interoperability:**
   - Capability-based selection, path optimization, or relay preference are
     OPTIONAL features, and LoMesh interoperability does not depend on
     capability exchange.
   - Nodes MAY choose to ignore or disregard peer capabilities as appropriate
     to their operational model.

   The capability concept enables LoMesh deployments to adapt to heterogeneous
   resources and policies without compromising the protocol’s minimal core.
   All such mechanisms are OPTIONAL and outside the strict requirements of
   LoMesh interoperability.
